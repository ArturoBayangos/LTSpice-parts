# LTSpice-parts
Parts for LTSpice commonly used by electronics hobbyists (with usage instructions).

LTSpice is a wonderful circuit simulator, but it doesn't include a lot of parts commonly used by hobbyists (e.g. the LM324 op amp), and adding 3rd party parts can be a challenge for newcomers.

**This github project aims to be both a collection of these common "jellybean" components, as well as instructions on how to use them in LTSpice.**

## Parts

* Transistors
  * MOSFETs
   * N-channel, TO-92
    * 2N7000 ([LTSpice tutorial](https://github.com/pepaslabs/LTSpice-parts/wiki/2N7000))
